# Ace-Player-Software-Development-Plan

This repository consists of software development plan for building a video streaming application called **Ace-Player**. This project is a part of my academics, we are instructed to build a software development plan proposal for an video streaming application like youtube.


# Description of our proposed product:

I created a project named as **'Ace Player - Software Development Plan'** as a part of my summer semester - CPSC 546 - Modern Software Management.

The goal of this project is to build a video streaming system called Ace player that allows users to watch and share videos in our system. Unlike traditional video streaming websites such as daily motion, YouTube, our Ace-player provides a highly interactive user experience. The proposed system includes many interesting user-engaging features such as making a friendzone with another user, chatting with the friends, recording a live event and telecasting. Our Ace-player will be fast and provides 24x7 non-stop video streaming service to all the users across the globe. 

In this project, we intended to follow Agile Scrum methodology for high visibility and control over the project progress. We also planned to employ well experienced Project Manager, Product Manager, Scrum process manager (Scrum Master) and other teams with young â€“ experienced team composition. The proposed budget of this project is approximately 3.05 Million. We planned to complete this project within 10 months including 10 Sprint cycles and 2 two release plans. In addition to this, we also provided our risk mitigation plans to control the hazards which may affect the project progress.
